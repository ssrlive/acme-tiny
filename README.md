# ACME-tiny powered by Rust

This is a Rust implementation of the ACME client, which is a simple client for the ACME protocol used to obtain SSL/TLS certificates from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

The code is translated from the [original Python version of ACME-tiny](https://github.com/diafygi/acme-tiny).
